for loops are error prone and not functional. They are overly verbose, so in general we dont like for loops in js. 

You can send data with a get request in two ways
You can use path variable which is with a number = url: localhost:8080/beers/1
or use can use Query string = url: ?key=value&key2=value2 ex = /kangaroofacts?canKick=true
app.get("/kangaroofacts", (req, res) => {
    res.send(req.query);
});


npm -g install nodemon
nodemon helps you with building the project for each time you save the project, so you dont have to stop it and run it again.

As before where we got a static folder for the html files and css, with js we will call it public. 

Things that should be looked more into: variables such as let, var and const
Pretty code
