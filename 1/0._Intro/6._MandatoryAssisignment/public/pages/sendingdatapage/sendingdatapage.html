<h1>Sending Data</h1>

<div class="content">
    <div id="mid-content">
        You can send data in express with a get request in two ways:<br>
You can use path variable which is with a number: localhost:8080/beers/1<br>
If you want to use path variable, you have to specify in the endpoint that you will use a path variable as so:

<div id="codefont">
    <br>
app.get(`/beers/:beersId`, (req, res) => {}
</div>
<br>
with the colon, it is specified that beersId is going to be the path variable, and so, you can use it with the req(uest).param.beerId, to get the path variable as a string. If you are going to use ID, where it is a number, you can simply use the Number notation infront of it:

<div id="codefont" style="font-size: 15px;">
    <br>
app.get(`/beers/:beersId`, (req, res) => {<br>
&emsp; const singleBeer = beerArray.filter(x => x.id === Number(req.params.beersId));<br>    
&emsp; res.send(singleBeer);<br>
});<br>
<br>
</div>

You can also use Query string: ?key=value&key2=value2 <br>
an example we have used is the kangaroofacts:  /kangaroofacts?canKick=true
If you want to use query string, you just have to specify the endpoint, and then inside the app method, you will respond with a request query:
<div id="codefont">
    <br>
app.get("/kangaroofacts", (req, res) => {<br>
&emsp; res.send(req.query);<br>
}); <br>
</div>

    </div>
