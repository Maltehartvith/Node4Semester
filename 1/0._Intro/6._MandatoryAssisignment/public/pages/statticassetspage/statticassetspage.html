<h1>Serving Stattic Assets in Express</h1>

<div class="content">
    <div id="mid-content">
        When we were working with Spring Boot we had a static folder for the html files and css. In express we call it public. 
        Inside this folder, we will make subfolders, for each category of items. <br>
        If we want to have many HTML pages, we create a subfolder called pages, and inside this, we have a folder for each page, which makes it clean to look on, 
        and easy to administrate. In this page folder, we can also have a specific .css and .js file for the specific page, if needed. <br>
        We can also make folders for assets, and if we want to split our HTML into more elements, such as a header, navigator, body and footer, 
        we can create these assets, and then assemble a full html page by putting these elements together. First of all, we have to make the public folder accesable 
        and able for the client to reach. We do that with app.use(express.static('public'));<br>
        An important note is when you are setting up path, in any of your assets, you have to think as if you are in the public folder. 
        Lets say that you are in the frontpage folder, the folder structure would be mainfolder>public>pages>frontpage, 
        but when you have to refere to a JavaScript file inside this folder, you must write the path as started from the public folder, 
        since you have set it as the static folder. So if you have to refere to a file in the frontpage folder, and the file you're in is in the frontpage folder, 
        you will write: ./pages/frontpage/frontpage.js.
