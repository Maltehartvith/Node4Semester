        Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime enviorment. <br>
        All in all it helps us with running JavaScript code in our terminal without we need a browser or other enviourment to run it through. 
        <br>If we want to run a JS file, we start by cd into the folder with the file in our terminal. 
        When we are in the same folder as the file, we can type "node file.js", and then hit enter. 
        Thereafter the code will be executed.
