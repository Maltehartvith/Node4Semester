        To create a server: <br> 
        Start off with making a package.json file (here we will have the dependencies) and remember to put {} into it. 
        Afterwards use npm install in the folder and thereafter inject the dependency in package.json write:<br> 
        <div id="codefont">
        "dependencies": { <br> 
            &emsp;"express": "version_number"<br> 
        } </div>,  or you can use npm install express inside your folder. Afterwards you can use npm install again.<br> <br> 
        After we have made this, we want to create our very own app.js file. In here is our application. We start with defining a express variable, 
        that we do by importing express into this variable.<br> 
        const express = require("express"); - and we also want to create an app variable, which is used with the express() method, that creates an express application:<br> 
        <div id="codefont">const app = express();<br></div>
        In the bottom of our code, we want to define the port we want our app to run on. We do that by using the app variable:<br> 
         
        <div id="codefont">
        const PORT = 5000<br>
        app.listen(PORT, () => {<br> 
            &emsp;console.log("Server is running on:", PORT);<br> 
        });<br> 
        </div>
        by calling the console.log method we will see in our terminal that "Server is running on: 5000", which gives us a clear message that our app is running. 
        <br> Now we can use our .get, .post, .patch, .put and .delete method on our app, where you will write an endpoint, and a callback function that uses request and response 
        - req, res for short. If we want information from the body, and use it in our method, we can use the request, 
        and when we want to send something back from our method we use the respond, so the client get a response sent to them. 
        A very simple example is from this assignment. The front page .get method is as following:<br> 
        <div id="codefont">
        app.get("/", (req, res) => {<br> 
            &emsp;res.send(frontpageConCat);<br> 
        });<br> 
    </div>
    </div>
