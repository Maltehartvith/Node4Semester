        If you want a global installation of nodemon write the following in your terminal: npm -g install nodemon <br>
        Nodemon helps you with building the project for each time you save the project, so you dont have to stop it and run it again. It keeps building your application each time you save your project, or for each change you make if you have turned on auto-save. As default, nodemon doesn't build for every file change, but you can modify this. If you create a nodemon.json file in your main folder for your project, you can then type:
        <div id="codefont">
        { <br>
	        &emsp;"ext": "js, json, html, css"<br>
        }<br>
        </div>
and from now on, everytime you make a change in one of these file-types and you got auto-save on, your project will be rebuild.
