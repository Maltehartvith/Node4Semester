<h1>Importing in node.js</h1>

<div class="content">
    <div id="mid-content">
        When you want to import something in node, you can use the require method, where you import something from another libary or file. 
        <br>On this site, I have a folder, which construct the pages, and that file are seperated from my main app.js file. 
        Then I can use the require method, which takes the elements i have chosen to export, which is done by defining a module.exports.  
        <br>In this module.exports I choose what I want to export with  key value pairs, and in my app.js i can import all the values. 
        I can also specify, if I only want two values from another file. 
        <br>Underneath i will show how to import all values from a file and only two values from a file respectively:<br>
        
        <div id="codefont" style="font-size: 13px;">
            <br>
        const page = require('./public/pagebuilder/pagebuilder.js');<br>
        const { importingpageConCat, bodyparsingPageConCat} = require('./public/pagebuilder/pagebuilder.js'); <br>
        </div>
        <br>
        The example where I only choose two values, it is called destructuration.
