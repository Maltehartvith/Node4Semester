<h1>Variables</h1>

<div class="content">
    <div id="high-content">
        There's 3 kind of variable declarations: var, let and const. <br>
        Var is the old keyword, which was used from '95 to 2015. These days we dont use var as it is outdated, but if you want your code to be ran on older browsers, 
        you can still use it. Otherwise we use let and const. As standard we use const, unless we have to modify/change the variable. <br>
        Const stands for Constant, which by the name, indicates that it is a constant variable, and therefore should not be changed. <br> 

        When you are creating an object in JavaScript we have stuff inside the object:<br>  <br> 
        <div id="codefont">
        const chicken{ <br>
            &emsp;sound: "pip" <- stuff <br>
        }<br> <br> 
        </div>
        The stuff is either a key or value. The one on the left side is the key, and right side is value, and togehter they are key value pairs.<br> 
        There is different kind og notations. There's dot notation: console.log(chicken.sound) - and there's squarebracket notation = console.log(chicken["sound"])
        If it's not needed: USE DOT NOTATION - it looks prettier and it is good to keep the same kind of notation, each time want a value from an object. <br> 
        <br> 
        When you have to set the id, it is better to set a variable that pluses. When you set ex AUTO_INCREMENT++ the next time you get the id it is
        AUTO_INCREMENT'ed. if you do ++AUTO_INCREMENT it will increase at the call.<br> 
        <br> 
        AUTO_INCREMENT  = 3:<br> 
        AUTO_INCREMENT++ = 3<br> 
        AUTO_INCREMENT = 4<br> 
        or <br> 
        ++AUTO_INCREMENT = 4<br> 
        AUTO_INCREMENT = 4<br> 
        
    </div>
