        for loops are error prone and not functional. They are overly verbose, so in general we dont like for loops in JavaScript. 
        Instead, we can use functional code, such as map or filter, if we have with an array of objects or variables.
        They go through an array based on a statement, and changes the array if the statement is succesful.
